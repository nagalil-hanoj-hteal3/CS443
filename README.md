# CS443 Database Management Systems
**Description**:

Many methods of storing and retrieving data have been developed since the inception of automated systems. The collection of data that these systems maintained became known as a database. Many database systems were developed over the years; however, most of them are no longer in use. They have been replaced by the "Relational" database model which makes exclusive use of Structured Query Language (SQL) for data definition, retrieval, and maintenance.

This course will explore the development of database systems, and the Relational Data Model. The role that SQL plays in today's computer systems will be explored. This course will center on the SQL language itself, selecting and maintaining data. Time is also spent on developing a relational database from the ground up. This includes data design using Entity relationship diagram, data normalization, database creation and implementation plus the maintenance and the operation of the database.

**Prerequisite**: 
CS 311: Data Structure and Algorithms
